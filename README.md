# AutomaticKicks
basically a complicated macro for Dark Souls Remastered
Uses WinAPIs to detect and simulate keyboard/mouse input.
Holding control causes your character to repeat a special kind of kick at perfectly-timed intervals. The intervals can be modified by the user with command-line arguments.
Example usage: "yourpath\easyworm.exe -5 200" will reduce the startup delay by 5 milliseconds, and increase the delay between worm attacks by ~200ms
Has some safety features to prevent the macro from behaving poorly when combined with other actions.
