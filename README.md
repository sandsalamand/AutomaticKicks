# AutomaticKicks
Basically a complicated macro for Dark Souls Remastered <br />
Uses WinAPIs to detect and simulate keyboard/mouse input. <br />
Holding control causes your character to repeat a worm kick at perfectly-timed intervals. The default intervals are already pretty close to optimal, but they can be modified by the user with command-line arguments. <br />
Has some safety features to prevent the macro from behaving poorly when combined with other actions. <br />
<br />
Simple usage: just download the exe and double ckick it
<br />
Advanced usage: "yourpath\easyworm.exe -5 200" will reduce the startup delay by 5 milliseconds, and increase the delay between worm attacks by ~200ms <br />
